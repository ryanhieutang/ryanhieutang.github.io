                    For a short period in August I got a chance to internship at Million Token, a decentralised crypto currency, where I worked as on their Discord bot application.
                    My main task was to maintain the security of their Discord community and increase the efficiency of user experience within the guild. Contributions I have made includes the development of their server statistics channels, bug fixes to their Discord bot, and bug fixes to their social media monitors all through DiscordJS.

                    From May to October 2023, I worked on a birthday interactive website in the form of a game that consists of activities and dialogues. Upon sharing this creation, it gained an impressive 1.9 million views and 421.8k positive interactions. This overwhelming resposne which has inspired me to consider utilising this momentum to create and commission similar "birthday" websites for others to give to their friends and family.<br><br>
                    The post successfully generated interest from over 50k individuals, where 50 of those were trafficked to sending me an email. As a result, commissions for this year are fully booked.</p>

                    To continue my learning in web development, I embarked on an exciting journey as a junior frontend developer at Powday, a dynamic startup focusing on the problems and it's solutions within the ski/snowboard industry. My role at Powday involved collaborating with a small team of both backend and frontend developers to create an immersive and user-friendly mobile application. Working within an agile development environment, I quickly adapted to the fast-paced nature of mobile application development while learning usages of Android Studio and working with React Native.
