                <p class="project-desc">In early Aug 2021 I got a chance to intern at Million Token, a decentralised crypto currency, where I worked as one of their many backend developers.<br><br>My main task was to maitain the security of their Discord community and increase the satisfaction of user experience within the guild. Contributions I have made includes the development of their server statistics channels, bug fixes to their Discord bot, and bug fixes to their social media monitors.

                <p class="project-desc">This agency started in early May 2021 where I provide weekly indications on profitable "lowkey" items that are likely to have a high resell price.<br></br>With experience dating back to 2021, I have accumulated over 30 satisfied clients where long term relationships have been established. This service is offered as a monthly subscription which varies in price depending on group size and other factors, thus a one-on-one consultation is offered to come up with a quote.
