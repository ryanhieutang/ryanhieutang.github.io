                    Cal-ch is a user friendly lazy calculator also known as Calculator Couch. This project was built using HTML, CSS and JS showcasing my knowledge on glassmorphism.<br><br>
                    It featured basic math functionalities through logical pieces of code and acts just like a standard calculator on your Mac or PC.

                    This landing page was one of my first commercial projects as a full stack developer! Programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS were used to build this website and I used AOS, a nifty animation library to get the job done.<br><br>
                    This landing page was split up into seven components: the hero, about, testimonials, prices, faq, twitter success, and footer.

                    This project targets a major problem within Discord, which is the ability to customise the aesthetics of the channel names where the stats are displaying. This was coded purely using Javascript which dives deep into experimenting with Discord's API (discord.js), making it easily configured by users.<br><br>
                    The features of this project includes the ability to keep track of total users, online users, and users with a certain role(s) through the manipulation of the channel's name.

                    Tuned Notify is an e-commerce business that I have been working closely with for over 7 months now, providing them with leads within my IaaS business. They have reached out with the intention to revamp their website, in which I delivered for them a cutting edge landing page that truly screams e-commerce. <br><br>
                    As this landing page will be used to obtain new members for their group, eye catching elements were used that ran seamlessly across the whole page from the navigation bar to the footer.
